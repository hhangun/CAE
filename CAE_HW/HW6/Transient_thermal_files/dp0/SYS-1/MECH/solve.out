 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 38%.  This 
 often indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required to      
 efficiently handle this simulation or a particularly slow hard drive    
 configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run faster on        
 identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive
